# Experiments

These are the following experiments supported by our framework's master branch. The table lists the values for the different identifiers used.

There may be additional or alternative experiments existing in different branches along with different projects.

Look [here](http://127.0.0.1:8000/research/terminology/#condition-identifiers) to understand what identifiers are.


### JND
- **Task**: Discrimination
- **Method**: Forced choice with Staircase

The JND experiment presents users with 2 plots, one with a higher correlation than the other.  The user then must choose the graph with the higher correlation by pressing the 'z' or 'm' keys to select the left or right graphs respectively.

### JND Radius
- **Task**: Discrimination
- **Method**: Forced choice with Staircase

This JND experiment presents users with 2 different shapes, one with a larger area than the other. The user then must choose the shape with the greater area by pressing the 'z' or 'm' keys to select the left or right graphs respectively.

### Stevens
- **Task**: Discrimination
- **Method**: Estimation with Bisection

The Stevens experiment presents users with 3 plots. The user then must adjust the correlation of the middle plot by pressing the 'z' or 'm' keys to increase or decrease the correlation, respectively. The goal is to adjust the middle plot so that its correlation is a midpoint between the 2 other plots, pressing spacebar when the estimate is made.

### Estimation
- **Task**: Discrimination
- **Method**: Matching

The Estimation experiment presents users with 2 shapes side-by-side. The task involves having to adjust the size of the modifiable shape so that it is the same size as the reference shape.

### Numerosity
The Numerosity experiment presents users with 1 randomly distributed plot. The task involves counting the number of target points before the stimulus expires and moves onto the response page. The goal is to adjust the slider on the response page to estimate the number of target points the user saw.

### Visual Search
The Visual Search experiment presents users with a target square of a certain color before the experiment begins. After which, the user will see 1 randomly distributed plot and must determine if the target square is in the plot.

### Ensemble Average
The Ensemble Average experiment presents users with a single scatterplot consisting of both target and distractor populations. Users will be cued on which features to attend to, and will be probed on corresponding feature information after each trial.

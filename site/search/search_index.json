Please keep in mind that roles in our team are not rigid, and you will not be pigeonholed into a single role. The idea of splitting up roles into \u2018Software Developer\u2019 and \u2018Technical Researcher\u2019 stemmed from the necessity of simplifying the onboarding process, as the codebase is quite daunting for new members initially. You will likely onboard with the role that you are interested in, but after onboarding, the role that you have within our team will likely be quite fluid depending on the needs of the lab and your personal goals and interests. Lastly, as you probably know, Google and StackOverflow will be your best friend when working with a new codebase, and if you have any questions, feel free to message our senior members on Slack. The tutorial will assume that you have little baseline knowledge of our tech stack, but feel free to skip over parts that you are already familiar with. Technical Researcher Onboarding If you\u2019ve chosen this route, you will likely work with developing experiments/conditions for research purposes. You might even be a COGS 402 student, as we\u2019ve noticed many past members go with this path as a student in that course. This section will provide some background on what we feel are the necessary skills to succeed in this role. Prerequisite Knowledge - Technical Researcher Note Please feel free to skip over the skills you are already experienced with. Github Github is a hosting platform for Git version control, and it allows different users to remotely collaborate on the same project. We use Github to host our VCL web framework repository. The main skills you will need with regards to git are understanding branches, commits, and pull requests. Please refer to this beginner guide to learn more. The code review process for our team ensures that the code written fits the lab\u2019s coding standards and does not introduce unwanted bugs. We don\u2019t necessarily have formal code reviewers assigned as of right now, but generally speaking, you can assign any senior coding team member to review a branch pull request. Popular Git GUIs: (You can use a GUI or just Git Bash whichever is most comfortable for you) SourceTree GitKraken GitHub Desktop Download Git JavaScript We recommend understanding the basics of Javascript and HTML before attempting to understand the framework. Here are a few resources: JavaScript JavaScript Mozilla documentation HTML The comprehensive references are mainly useful when writing code and you might forget the language syntax. JsPsych jsPsych is the backbone of our application and is the main reason why we transitioned from a Java framework to a JavaScript framework back in 2018. JsPsych is the go-to JavaScript library for running psych experiments in a browser. The timeline array provides an intuitive way to design and structure experiments for both developers and researchers. The jsPsych documentation provides a comprehensive guide for how to use the library. We recommend checking out their \u201cHello World\u201d and \u201cSimple Reaction Time Task\u201d Tutorials: Hello World Tutorial rt-task Tutorial D3 D3 is a data visualization library for JavaScript. We use D3 to generate the plots for all of the experiments that we run. We recommend becoming familiar with D3 if you are creating a new condition. Success Congrats on finishing the Technical Researcher section! You can continue to the concluding section now.

Here are a few resources: JavaScript JavaScript Mozilla documentation HTML CSS jQuery The comprehensive references are mainly useful when writing code and you might forget the language syntax. Express.js + Node.js + NPM Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on the Chrome V8 engine. One of the primary ways it is used is to allow Javascript code to be run server-side. Think of Node.js as a way to run Javascript code similarly to how Java or Python code are run using their respective runtime environments. Node.js is just a way for us to run Javascript code outside of a browser environment. Along with Node.js we use a tool called Node Package Manager (npm). npm is a package registry that contains Node.js code libraries which are useful for development. It is used to handle dependency management, version management, and package installation primarily through the CLI. Express is a web application framework and standard server framework for Node.js, and it provides a bunch of features for building web-apps and APIs. We use express to handle routing (GET and POSTrequests), middleware functions (functions called when a request is received on the specified URL), and also start the localhost server for development testing. Express Routing Express Middleware body-parser Web APIs and HTTP Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are a way for a web client to interact with a web service and utilizes the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to perform queries. APIs written with ExpressJS are composed of many routes and middleware functions, and each route has one middleware function associated with it. Routes are used to define the \u201cendpoint\u201d or specific URL in which the request is expected to occur. Middleware functions define the behaviour of the API when a certain request is made on a specified URL from the routing. Middleware functions also define expected information in a request, and it also specifies how the API responds to the request (either with information or error messages). We primarily use our API written in app.js as a means to serve web pages. In general, web APIs use four main HTTP methods to achieve a robust interface: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. For the purpose of our framework, you mainly need to understand GET and POST requests. GET When you perform a GET request on a specific URL, you retrieve information without modifying it in any way. The data that you receive in a GET request is specified by the response of the server. Think of it as getting information from a collection. If for example, I want to get all users from an arbitrary API, I could make a GET request to \u201chttps://{example_API_root}.com/users/\u201d. Where \u201c{example_API_root}\u201d is the root URL of the host server, and \u201c/users/\u201d is specified by the routing. POST A POST request is primarily used to create a new resource. Think of it as adding new information to a collection. Note that this is an oversimplification of APIs and HTTP, and if you want to gain a better understanding of building APIs (such as with RESTful concepts), we recommend these links: ELI5 for APIs HTTP Requests RESTful APIs JsPsych jsPsych is the backbone of our application and is the main reason why we transitioned from a Java framework to a JavaScript framework back in 2018.

Technical Debt and Writing \u201cGood\u201d Code Writing good code is hard. It takes years of experience to learn best practices well, and even the most experienced programmers will write shitty code from time to time. Nonetheless, in a project with as many moving pieces as our codebase, it is important to try our best to write \u201cgood\u201d code and minimize technical debt. Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional work caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. Some examples are messy code formatting , duplications, unnecessarily large time complexity, architectural flaws, lacking documentation and other bad coding practices. Note that our team isn\u2019t large, and as a result, relatively significant amounts of technical debt will naturally accumulate over time. It\u2019s important to assess the choices we make to minimize technical debt build-up while also balancing the time it takes to implement the \u2018optimal solution\u2019. Some examples of technical debt present in our codebase right now (2021/02/07): Using jQuery over a more modern front-end library (such as React or Vue) Server-side architecture is nonoptimal, and basically, the only purpose of the express server is to serve static (mostly HTML) files to the client Not using best practices in coding. Ex. Using var to instantiate variables where let or const would be better Repetitive code in places such as experiment and trial display HTML files It is important to note that these fundamental design choices were likely made very early on in the design process of our framework, but as a result, developers in the present and future will need to work around these decisions long after they were made. This is not to say that those decisions were necessarily \u2018wrong\u2019 at the time. It is likely that they were developed with scope and stakeholders entirely considered, but as time went on, the stakeholder needs changed. But now, the design choices made early in development would require a massive refactor to change. In essence, think about minimizing technical debt as you are implementing new features, but not at the expense of sanity. Abstract for when you think there will be a use case for in the future, but not just for the sake of doing it. Next Steps Congrats on getting through our onboarding documentation!
